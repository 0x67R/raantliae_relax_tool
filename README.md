# RAAntliaeRelaxTool - Base Encoder, Number System Converter and Hash Generator

I didn't find any Windows (CLI) tools that could do these processes simply without having to type in many commands. 
So I developed 'RAAntliaeRelaxTool ' so that I could automate these processes. The tool generates various results from a single data entry.

# Features
Converts 'strings' to Hexadecimal, Octal, Decimal, and Binary numbering systems (64-bit, 32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit).
Encode the 'strings' to Base64.
It is also an MD5 Hash Generator and a Secure Hash Generator (SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512).

This tool is available for Windows operating systems, has been perfectly tested in versions:

- Windows 7 (All Versions)
- Windows 8, 8.1
- Windows 10 (All Versions)

## How to install

Download the [RAAntliaeRelaxTool](https://github.com/0x67R/raantliae_relax_tool.git), place it in the desired folder on your system, add the path of 'raantliae_relax_tool' to the variable 'PATH'

Enjoy!!!
